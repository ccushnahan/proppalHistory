# PropPal History

Have you ever used the PropPal website and seen that a property has recently "Updated"? Has price changed or sale status changed? When looking at a listing it does not actually say what has updated.  That information is available on the page but it is not shown to the user.

This is a small extension to extract the update information about the property. It lists the properties update history showing how many updates there have been, what has changed and when.

## Installation

Extension has not been submitted so steps to install are though firefox's temporary addon option:

1. Download files in repository
2. Open firefox
3. Navigate to "about:debugging"
4. Click "This Firefox" link
5. Click load temporary addon button
6. Select file from repo

## How to use

1. Navigate to "propertypal.com" website
2. Open property listing you are interested in
3. Click on the extension icon on the toolbar or extension menu
4. Popup with update history of property will appear
